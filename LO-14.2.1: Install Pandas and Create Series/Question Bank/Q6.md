Write a Python function `analyze_sales(sales_list)` that takes a list of daily sales figures as input.
Inside the function:
1. Create a Pandas Series from the list.
2. Assign the index as `['Day1', 'Day2', 'Day3', ...] depending on the length of the list.
3. Return the created Series.

**Example Input:**
`[100, 200, 150]`

**Expected Output:**
```text
Day1    100
Day2    200
Day3    150
dtype: int64
```

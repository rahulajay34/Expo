## Question 1

**Type:** Multiple Choice (Single Correct)  
**Difficulty:** Foundation

### Scenario: The High-Stakes Launch

You are the Marketing Director for a new, high-end ergonomic chair company targeting software engineers. You have a limited budget of $5,000 for the launch campaign and need to maximize **sales conversions**, not just awareness.

Your analyst presents two influencer options based on recent performance data:

| Metric            | Influencer A (Tech Reviewer) | Influencer B (Desk Setup Specialist) |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| **Followers**     | 250,000                      | 15,000                               |
| **Avg. Likes**    | 2,500                        | 1,200                                |
| **Avg. Comments** | 50                           | 300                                  |
| **Cost per Post** | $4,500                       | $1,000                               |

The Engagement Rate (ER) is calculated using the standard formula:

$$ER = \frac{Likes + Comments}{Followers} \times 100$$

**Constraints:**

- The product price is $800 (high consideration).
- The goal is immediate ROI, not long-term branding.
- Influencer A's audience is broad tech interest; Influencer B's audience is specifically home-office enthusiasts.

**Based on the data and constraints, which strategy is statistically and psychologically MOST likely to yield the highest ROI?**

- [ ] **A.** Choose Influencer A because their 1% ER is standard for the industry and they provide 16x more reach.
- [ ] **B.** Choose Influencer B because their 10% ER and high comment volume indicate a 'Community' dynamic suitable for high-consideration purchases.
- [ ] **C.** Choose Influencer A because 'Likes' are a stronger indicator of purchase intent than 'Comments' for visual products.
- [ ] **D.** Split the budget: Negotiate a lower rate with Influencer A to get brand validation and use the rest on Facebook Ads.

## Question 2

**Type:** Multiple Choice (Multiple Correct)  
**Difficulty:** Foundation

### Scenario: Escaping the 'Red Ocean'

An aspiring influencer wants to enter the **Cooking & Food** market, which is currently oversaturated (a 'Red Ocean'). They are a trained pastry chef who specializes in gluten-free baking and has a background in chemistry. They have no budget for paid promotion and must grow organically.

**Task:**
Identify the strategies below that successfully apply the **'Super Niche'** concept to minimize competition and maximize early traction. (Select ALL that apply)

**Constraints:**

- Must leverage existing expertise.
- Must target a specific, underserved audience segment.
- Must avoid direct competition with established generalist food channels.

**Options:**

- [ ] **A.** Launch a channel called 'The Science of Gluten-Free Pastry' focusing on the chemical reactions in baking for food geeks.
- [ ] **B.** Create 'Easy 5-Minute Meals' videos to appeal to the widest possible audience of busy parents.
- [ ] **C.** Start a blog reviewing the top restaurants in New York City.
- [ ] **D.** Develop a persona: 'The Celiac Chemist', creating visually satisfying, scientifically accurate baking experiments for gluten-intolerant viewers.
- [ ] **E.** Post high-quality photos of desserts with generic motivational quotes to build a lifestyle brand.

## Question 3

**Type:** Case Study & Analysis  
**Difficulty:** Advanced

### Case Study Analysis: The 'Lipstick King' Failure

A European luxury cosmetics brand attempted to replicate the success of **Li Jiaqi (The Lipstick King of China)** in the US market. They hired a famous Hollywood actor for a 30-minute livestream event to sell their new matte lipstick range.

**The Event Details:**

- **Host**: A-List Actor (High fame, low product knowledge).
- **Format**: Scripted Q&A with a host, high production value, TV-style lighting.
- **Testing**: The actor swatched one shade on their hand.
- **Result**: 200,000 concurrent viewers, but only 0.5% conversion rate (disastrously low).

**Task:**
Analyze this failure by contrasting it with Li Jiaqi's core methodologies. Explain why the celebrity approach failed to trigger the sales response.

**Submission Guidelines**

- **Analysis**: Identify 3 specific principles from Li Jiaqi's strategy that were missing in this campaign.
- **Psychological Impact**: Explain how the _lack_ of these principles affected consumer trust.
- **Correction**: Propose one specific change to the livestream format that would have aligned it better with influencer marketing best practices.
- **Length**: 200-300 words.

## Question 4

**Type:** Design Challenge  
**Difficulty:** Advanced

### Design Challenge: From Audience to Community

You have taken over the social media accounts for a sustainable sneaker brand. Currently, the brand has **100,000 followers** but suffers from the "Ghost Town" effect:

- Posts get likes but almost no comments.
- Users do not interact with each other.
- The content is 100% broadcast (product photos, sale announcements).

**Constraint:**

- You cannot increase the ad budget.
- You must improve the **Community Engagement Rate** within 90 days.

**Task:**
Develop a **Community Activation Plan** to transition this passive audience into an active community.

**Submission Guidelines**

- **Metric Definition**: Define a specific KPI you will track that is NOT 'Likes' or 'Follower Count'.
- **Content Shift**: Describe how you will change the _type_ of content posted (give 2 examples).
- **Ritual Design**: Propose one recurring 'Community Ritual' that encourages lateral (user-to-user) interaction.
- **Format**: Use bullet points for clarity.

## Question 5

**Type:** Strategic Recommendation  
**Difficulty:** Expert

### Strategy Document: The AI Influencer Pivot

A mid-sized tech accessories brand is considering replacing their human micro-influencers with a proprietary **AI Influencer** (a virtual persona) to cut costs and avoid potential PR scandals.

**Constraints:**

- The brand's core value is "Human Creativity."
- The target audience is Gen Z, who are highly sensitive to "inauthentic" corporate tactics.
- Budget is tight; they can't afford top-tier human talent.

**Task:**
Write a strategic recommendation on whether to proceed with the AI Influencer. If YES, how to mitigate the authenticity backlash. If NO, propose a hybrid alternative.

**Submission Guidelines**

- **Recommendation**: State your position clearly (Go / No-Go / Hybrid).
- **Risk Analysis**: Analyze the specific risk regarding the "Uncanny Valley" or "Trust Gap" for this specific audience.
- **Strategic Approach**: If proceeding, outline the **Persona Profile** (Backstory, Flaws, Interests) that would make the AI palatable. If rejecting, explain the economic alternative.
- **Length**: Approximately 250 words.

# Answer Key & Rubrics

## Question 1

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
Option 2 is correct. Influencer B has a significantly higher Engagement Rate ($$1500 / 15000 = 10\%$$) compared to Influencer A ($$2550 / 250000 \approx 1\%$$). More importantly, the ratio of comments to likes for Influencer B is much higher, indicating active discussion (Community) rather than passive consumption. For a high-ticket item ($800), trust and active engagement are required to close sales, which Micro-influencers in a 'Super Niche' (Desk Setups) typically provide better than broad Macro-influencers. Option A focuses on vanity metrics (Reach). Option C is incorrect; comments correlate more strongly with purchase intent.

## Question 2

**Correct Answers: A, D**

**Explanation:**
Options 1 and 4 are correct because they layer multiple specific attributes (Gluten-Free + Professional Baking + Chemistry/Science) to create a 'Super Niche'. This specific intersection has lower competition and higher relevance to a targeted tribe. Option B is a generic 'Red Ocean' strategy with massive competition. Option C is a different business model (Reviewer vs. Creator) and is also saturated. Option E lacks value-add and specific targeting.

## Question 3 (Rubric)

**Model Answer Highlights:**

- **Analysis:**
  1.  **Lack of Brutal Honesty:** The actor followed a PR script vs. Li Jiaqi's critical reviews.
  2.  **Insufficient Stress-Testing:** Swatching on a hand vs. Li Jiaqi's marathon lip application.
  3.  **Expertise vs. Fame:** The actor relied on source attractiveness (fame) rather than source credibility (expertise).
- **Psychological Impact:** The event felt like a commercial (creating distance/skepticism) rather than a consultation (creating trust).
- **Correction:** Implement a "Torture Test" segment (e.g., eat greasy food while wearing the lipstick) to prove value with evidence.

**Grading Notes:**
Look for mentions of Li Jiaqi's 'Brutal Honesty' or 'Expertise'. The answer must distinguish between 'Fame' (Celebrity) and 'Influence' (Trust/Action). The correction must involve a demonstration of product value, not just better production quality.

## Question 4 (Rubric)

**Model Answer Highlights:**

- **Metric:** Conversation Rate (comments per reach, specifically lateral replies between users).
- **Content Shift Examples:**
  1.  **UGC Spotlights:** Stories of where customers walked, not just product shots.
  2.  **Open-Ended Dilemmas:** Polls/Debates (e.g., "Recycled laces vs Biodegradable soles?").
- **Ritual:** "Sole-Searching Sundays" (or similar) - a weekly prompt encouraging users to share personal wins/stories, creating lateral interaction.

**Grading Notes:**
The answer must move away from broadcasting (talking AT) to facilitating (talking WITH). Key elements: Lateral interaction (users talking to users), UGC usage, and metrics that track depth of engagement (comments/shares) rather than vanity metrics (likes).

## Question 5 (Rubric)

**Model Answer Highlights:**

- **Recommendation:** Hybrid Approach (The "Mascot" Strategy).
- **Risk Analysis:** Replacing humans entirely risks a "Trust Gap" with Gen Z and contradicts the "Human Creativity" value; potential for Uncanny Valley effect.
- **Strategic Approach:** Use the AI as a "Digital Mascot" (e.g., "Glitch") for technical specs/data, while keeping humans for emotional connection. This balances cost-efficiency with authenticity.

**Grading Notes:**
Answers should demonstrate an understanding that AI influencers struggle with 'Authenticity'. A good answer will either propose a transparent AI (not hiding it) or a hybrid model. Pure replacement of humans without addressing the 'Human Creativity' value contradiction is a strategic error.
